# ZSH Custom

This repo holds zsh customizations that I like. 

## Useage

This should be used in conjunction with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
Set `$ZSH_CUSTOM` to the location of this repository (in oh-my-zsh's `.zshrc`) and oh-my-zsh will automatically source all the .zsh files here.

## Powerline fonts
I like the `agnoster` theme, which requires powerline-patched fonts. Install the packages `powerline powerline-fonts`, and restart for it to take effect. Or install by hand from [github](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
